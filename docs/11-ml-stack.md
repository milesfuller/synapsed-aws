# ML Stack

## Overview
The ML Stack provides infrastructure for machine learning model training, deployment, and inference in the Synapsed platform. It implements scalable ML infrastructure with support for various ML frameworks and deployment patterns.

## Components

### Model Training
- **Purpose**: Train ML models at scale
- **Implementation**:
  - SageMaker training jobs
  - Training data management
  - Hyperparameter optimization
  - Model versioning

### Model Deployment
- **Purpose**: Deploy models for inference
- **Implementation**:
  - SageMaker endpoints
  - A/B testing capabilities
  - Auto-scaling configuration
  - Model monitoring

### Data Processing
- **Purpose**: Process data for ML workflows
- **Implementation**:
  - Glue jobs for data preparation
  - EMR clusters for big data processing
  - Feature store for feature management
  - Data versioning

### Inference Infrastructure
- **Purpose**: Run model inference
- **Implementation**:
  - Batch inference jobs
  - Real-time inference endpoints
  - Inference monitoring
  - Performance optimization

## Dependencies
