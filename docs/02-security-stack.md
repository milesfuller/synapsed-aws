# Security Stack

## Overview

The Security Stack provides the foundational security infrastructure for the Synapse-D platform. It establishes the core security services, policies, and controls needed to protect the platform's resources and data.

## Components

### IAM Roles and Policies

The stack creates IAM roles and policies for:
- Service roles for Lambda functions
- Cross-account access policies
- Least privilege access controls
- Role assumption policies

### KMS (Key Management Service)

The KMS service is used for:
- Encryption key management
- Key rotation policies
- Cross-account key sharing
- Key usage policies

### VPC Configuration

The VPC configuration includes:
- Private and public subnets
- Security groups with least privilege access
- Network ACLs
- VPC endpoints for AWS services

### Security Groups

Security groups are created for:
- Lambda functions
- API Gateway
- RDS databases
- Other AWS services

## Integration with Other Stacks

The Security Stack is referenced by other stacks to provide security resources:
- Relay Stack: For WebRTC security and network access
- Subscription Stack: For secure payment processing
- Authentication Stack: For identity and access management
- WebApp Stack: For application security

## Security Controls

### Encryption

- Data at rest encryption using KMS
- Data in transit encryption using TLS
- End-to-end encryption for P2P communication

### Access Control

- IAM roles with least privilege
- Resource-based policies
- Service control policies
- Permission boundaries

### Network Security

- VPC isolation
- Security groups and NACLs
- VPC endpoints
- Private subnets for sensitive resources

### Monitoring and Auditing

- CloudTrail for API activity logging
- Config for resource configuration tracking
- Security Hub for security findings
- GuardDuty for threat detection

## Best Practices

1. Follow the principle of least privilege
2. Implement defense in depth
3. Use encryption for all sensitive data
4. Regularly rotate keys and credentials
5. Monitor and audit security events
6. Implement secure defaults
7. Use security groups with minimal permissions
