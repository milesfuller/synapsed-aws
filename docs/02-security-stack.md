# Security Stack

## Overview
The Security Stack establishes the foundational security controls and cross-account access mechanisms for the Synapsed platform. It implements AWS Organizations structure and IAM roles for secure cross-account access.

## Components

### AWS Organizations
- **Purpose**: Establish organizational structure and policies
- **Implementation**:
  - Organization structure with Security, Infrastructure, and Workloads OUs
  - Service Control Policies (SCPs) for each OU
  - Tag policies for resource tagging
  - Backup policies

### IAM Roles
- **Security Audit Role**:
  - **Purpose**: Cross-account security auditing
  - **Implementation**:
    - Organization-wide access
    - SecurityAudit and AWSConfigUserAccess policies
    - OU-aware permissions
    - Conditional access based on resource tags

- **Logging Read Role**:
  - **Purpose**: Centralized logging access
  - **Implementation**:
    - S3 bucket read permissions
    - CloudWatch Logs access
    - Organization-wide scope
    - Resource-based permissions

### Security Policies
- **Purpose**: Define security standards and controls
- **Implementation**:
  - Password policies
  - Access key rotation policies
  - MFA enforcement
  - Resource tagging requirements

### Cross-Account Access
- **Purpose**: Enable secure access across accounts
- **Implementation**:
  - Role assumption policies
  - Permission boundaries
  - Session duration limits
  - Access logging

## Dependencies

## Outputs
- Organization ID
- OU IDs
- IAM Role ARNs
- Policy ARNs
- Cross-account access configurations

## Security Considerations
- Least privilege principle for all roles
- Regular access reviews
- Automated compliance checks
- Secure session management
