# Logging Stack

## Overview
The Logging Stack provides centralized logging infrastructure for the Synapsed platform. It establishes log collection, storage, and analysis capabilities across all accounts in the organization.

## Components

### CloudWatch Logs
- **Purpose**: Centralized log collection and storage
- **Implementation**:
  - Log groups for each service and environment
  - Log retention policies (90 days by default)
  - Log encryption using KMS
  - Log subscription filters

### S3 Log Storage
- **Purpose**: Long-term log archival
- **Implementation**:
  - S3 bucket for log archival
  - Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
  - Access logging
  - Versioning for audit purposes

### Log Shipping
- **Purpose**: Transport logs to centralized storage
- **Implementation**:
  - Kinesis Data Streams for real-time log shipping
  - Lambda functions for log transformation
  - Firehose for batch log delivery
  - Cross-account log shipping

### Log Analysis
- **Purpose**: Analyze logs for insights and security
- **Implementation**:
  - Athena for SQL-based log querying
  - OpenSearch for full-text search
  - CloudWatch Insights for operational metrics
  - Custom dashboards

## Dependencies
- Security Stack
- Configuration Management Stack

## Outputs
- CloudWatch Log Group ARNs
- S3 Bucket ARNs
- Kinesis Stream ARNs
- Lambda Function ARNs
- Athena Workgroup ARNs

## Security Considerations
- Encryption for logs in transit and at rest
- Access controls based on least privilege
- Audit logging for log access
- Data retention compliance
