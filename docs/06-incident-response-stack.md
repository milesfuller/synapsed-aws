# Incident Response Stack

## Overview
The Incident Response Stack provides automated incident detection, response, and recovery capabilities for the Synapsed platform. It implements incident management workflows and automated response actions.

## Components

### Incident Detection
- **Purpose**: Detect security and operational incidents
- **Implementation**:
  - CloudWatch Alarms
  - EventBridge rules
  - Custom detection rules
  - Anomaly detection

### Automated Response
- **Purpose**: Automate incident response actions
- **Implementation**:
  - Lambda functions for response
  - Step Functions for workflows
  - Automated containment
  - Recovery procedures

### Incident Management
- **Purpose**: Track and manage incidents
- **Implementation**:
  - Incident tracking system
  - Status updates
  - Communication templates
  - Post-mortem documentation

### Recovery Procedures
- **Purpose**: Automated recovery from incidents
- **Implementation**:
  - Backup restoration
  - Failover procedures
  - Data recovery
  - Service restoration
