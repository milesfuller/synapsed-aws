# GitHub Repository Setup

To push this project to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: synapsed-aws
   - Description: AWS CDK implementation for Synapsed
   - Choose Public or Private
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Use these commands:

```bash
# If you haven't already set up the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/synapsed-aws.git

# If you've already set up the remote but need to update it
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/synapsed-aws.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

3. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

4. If you're using SSH instead of HTTPS, use the SSH URL format:
   ```
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/synapsed-aws.git
   ```

5. If you're prompted for credentials, enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token if you have 2FA enabled).
